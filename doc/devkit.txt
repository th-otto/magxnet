Notes for Pure C developers
---------------------------

In this folder you'll find the basic library and header files for
writting sockets compatible applications. Most used (about 99% ;-)
are two files, <sys/socket.h> and <netinet/in.h>. Both include
<compiler.h>, if you have an older (or modified) version of this
file, please make sure to comment out the #ifndef __MINT__ part
of modify it in such a way as to selectively activate it.

If you want to use Finstat()/Foutstat() please use my modified
version of PCTOSLIB.LIB, the original (from Pure C v1.1) has
a BUG that makes these two calls useless, ie although the 
prototype in TOS.H is correct ( long Finstat (int f) ) they
use the file handle as long, thus the result is wrong.
(a thanks to Henk Robbers here for TTDiger which is IMO the
best tool for such things).

PCSTDLIB.LIB is unfortunately not updated for sockets, not a big
problem for prototype projects but quite a trouble for ports
from other platforms. Possible solutions:

For fdopen (most common) you can use something like:

/* Associate a file or socket descripter (small integer) with a 
stream */

FILE	*fdopen ( int handle, char *mode)
{
	FILE *fp = (FILE *)calloc (1, sizeof (FILE));
	
	if (fp == NULL)
		return (fp);
	fp->Handle = handle;
	if ( *mode != 'w')
		return (NULL);
	fp->BufStart = malloc (BUFSIZ);
	fp->BufPtr = fp->BufLvl = fp->BufStart;
	fp->BufEnd = (char *)fp->BufStart + BUFSIZ;
	fp->Flags = 0xA;
	fp->ungetFlag = -1;
	return (fp);
}

For other modes fp->Flags might need other values, you should either
check freopen of the PCSTDLIB or wait for me to extend the library :-)

The other problem is with errno and the relevant error messages, you
can return -1 (generic error) for sockets errors until we fix this
one too.

Alternatively you can use the Pure C compatible MiNTLib by Christian
Felsch but in this case you'll also have to use the relevant header
files (the FILE structure is completely different between the two).

The above library can also be used as the LAST lib in your project
file for accessing some unimplemented functions in Pure C libs.

Please contact me if you have any problems with porting or developing
any applications and I hope we'll find a solution.

Sources for MagiCNet, tools, net library, drivers etc will be 
available soon, I need first to clear out my own mess of header
files locations after so many tests with MiNTNet and MagiCNet
development.

Good luck with MagiCNet
