The binary distribution consists of either:

mntinc49.tgz and mntbin49.tgz (for 68000 compatibility)
or
mntinc49.tgz and mnt02049.tgz (for CPU >= 68020)

to install the binary distribution:

1. cd /usr
2. tar xvzf mntinc49.tgz
3. tar xvzf mntbin49.tgz or mnt02049.tgz
4. move or symlink the contents of /usr/lib/m680[02]0 to
/usr/lib.

Read README.FAQ and the other information files in the distribution.


Source distribution:

The source distribution consists of mntlib49.tgz and mntinc49.tgz.

To compile your own binary of the MiNTlib, I recommend at least gcc
2.7.x, gas 2.9, and Atari gcc binutils PL40.  Gas 2.51 has a bug; it
doesn't like \r in its input files.  Gas 1.38 should work, but it does
not optimize the object code and will not recognize opcodes for
processors > 68030 (should you choose to build the lib for 68040 or
greater).

If you must, you can use gcc 2.5.8 or 2.6.x with minor changes to the
optimization options in the Makefile.

Basic steps:

1. Create a working directory

2. Create directory /usr/lib/m68000 or /usr/lib/m68020

3. Copy mntlib49.tgz and mntinc49.tgz into your working dir.

4. tar xvzf mntlib49.tgz ; tar xvzf mntinc49.tgz 

5. ls  should yield:

include/ lib/

6. cd lib

7. make top020 (for a >= 68020 build) or
   make top    (for a 68000 build)

8. Wait.  A long.  Time.

9. binary archives and startup modules will be found in 
/usr/lib/m68000 or /usr/lib/m68020

10. Copy the contents of working_dir/include into /usr/include
