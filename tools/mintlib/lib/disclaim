
There is no global copyright on the MiNTlib.  Because the code was
contributed independently by many people, or was borrowed from various
sources, each source file in the library may have its own specific
licence.  Read the source file if you are unsure of the legal status
of a particular library component.  In addition, without any prejudice
to the distribution terms of individual components of the library, you
are reminded that, as a whole, this library, a compilation of free
software, comes to you without any warranty of any sort, explicit or
implied.  The library's maintainers and contributors, past and
present, shall not be held responsible for any kind of damage, direct
or indirect, physical or otherwise, that may have resulted from use or
misuse of any part or combination of parts of this library in any
context whatsoever.  Use of this library implies that you agree with
the above terms and assume all the risks associated with its use.

Most of this library is public domain and hence may be used without
further restrictions. Please note the following exceptions and make
every effort to adhere to the following licences if you use the
library modules listed below (list may not be exhaustive):
